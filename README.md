# Project description
In this project I've analyzed game sales data from 1980 to 2016. From this analysis I draw a couple of predictions for 2017. 

The main goal of the project was to practice exploratory and statistical data analysis, data visualization and hypothesis testing.

In the end I try to make predictions for 2017 based on the data I've analyzed.
